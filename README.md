# Mein-first-repo
Just a starting repo to get to know closer with GitHub

Ahoy there!

Allow me to introduce myself, my string identifier is Muhammad Hanif Sudibyo, shortened to Hanif to reduce time spend typing  ;)

Currently a college student at Airlangga University, Indonesia
Taking a major at Data Science, yes I'm that guy in the next room playing with this so-called "data"

You could send a distress signal to me at this address should you enquire some silly (or not so silly) question(s) that I need to respond to:
muhammad.hanif.sudibyo-2020@stmm.unair.ac.id

Have a nice day!  :D  (or week, or month, whatever floats your paper boat)
